# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See
`.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from
research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS
CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app
or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps
or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory,
offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS
CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Type safety and architecture gate**: Confirm server-first placement for
  business logic, strict TypeScript compliance, and clear separation between UI
  and domain logic.
- **Security gate**: Identify authn/authz controls, secret handling approach,
  and input validation boundaries for each user flow.
- **Data integrity gate**: Document schema and mutation impact, including
  Drizzle update path and rollback/mitigation considerations for
  reporting-critical data.
- **Quality gate**: Define required validation commands (`npm run lint`,
  `npm run build`) and list automated tests required for behavior-changing work.
- **UI system gate**: Confirm affected UI uses Tailwind CSS and
  shadcn-compatible components, and identify reusable component extraction for
  repeated patterns.
- **UX and accessibility gate**: Define how loading, empty, error, and
  keyboard-accessible interaction states will be delivered for affected screens.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
