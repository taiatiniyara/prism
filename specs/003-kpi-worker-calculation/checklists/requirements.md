**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding
to planning **Created**: 2026-03-23 **Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1: all checklist items passed.
- No open clarification markers remain.
- Implementation validation: `npm run lint` failed due to pre-existing
  repository lint violations outside this feature scope (e.g.
  `app/migration/service.ts`, settings/upload forms, and shared table
  components).
- Implementation validation: `npm run build` passed successfully, including
  route generation for `api/data-entry/kpi-worker/status`.
- Implementation validation: `npm run test` passed successfully (37 files, 50
  tests).
